In the structure of the project you can find the store with redux, redux-toolkit and sagas as an example so that you can see my knowledge in these technologies together with test examples.
Most of the components of the application are tested except for the views.

To do the tests with MetaMask it is necessary to have the "MetaMask" extension installed in your browser and have an account. I associated the wallet with accounts provided by the ganache software. With the sado of these accounts I was able to make transactions
